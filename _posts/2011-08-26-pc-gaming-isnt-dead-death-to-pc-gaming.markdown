title: PC Gaming isn't dead! Death to PC Gaming!
tags: gaming, off-topic

I don't normally write blog posts about gaming stuff, but this was too good to pass up. Here's the [Ars Technica 
article](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/08/razer-to-release-stylish-2800-gaming-laptop-complete-with-dynamic-buttons.ars) 
I'm referencing.

A large argument in favor of PC Gaming is that you don't have to buy a whole new system every few years, you can just 
upgrade the parts that are out of date.

An argument against PC Gaming is the cost of entry for a decent system is too high (compared to console gaming).

Another argument against it is that the hardware is not standardized, so developers have to consider many possible 
permutations of setup when they make games. And trying to manage driver versions to find one that works is hell.

Razer has released a gaming laptop (so the parts are not easily user-replaceable) with a custom touchpad/screen (which 
needs its own driver and which developers will have to write game code specifically to support) for $2,800 (so... not 
cheap). And then their marketing campaign is "[PC GAMING ISN'T 
DEAD!](http://www.ubergizmo.com/2011/08/razer-pc-gaming-is-not-dead/)"

Bravo.
