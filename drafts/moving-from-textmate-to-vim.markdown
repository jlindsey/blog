A little over a year ago now, I dragged TextMate.app from Applications to Trash and never looked back. Back then, I was doing Ruby on Rails development
most of the time; now I'm doing more Devops stuff - writing automation scripts, daemons, etc. Getting rid of my attachment to TextMate and learning Vim
was probably the best thing I did to help me transition from web dev work (which I mostly enjoyed) to Devops-style work (which I enjoy much more).

Vim is ubiquitous. It lives on your server, on your virtual machines, everywhere.
